## What is the Pin Feature?

The pin feature lets you mark important clusters and manuals as favorites, so they always appear at the top of your list for quick access.

## How to Use

### Pin a Cluster

1. Go to the **Clusters** page (Page 1)
2. Hover over any cluster card
3. Click the **pin icon** button that appears
4. The cluster is now pinned and moves to the top!

**Visual Indicators:**
- Pinned clusters show a filled pin icon next to the title
- Pinned clusters always appear first in the list

### Pin a Manual

1. Go to the **Training Manuals** page (Page 2)
2. Find the manual you want to pin
3. Click the **Pin** button in the actions area
4. The manual is now pinned and moves to the top!

**Visual Indicators:**

## Benefits

**For Teachers with Multiple Clusters:**
- Quickly access your primary teaching cluster
- Keep frequently-used clusters at your fingertips
- No more scrolling through long lists

**For Administrators Managing Many Manuals:**
- Pin current year's training materials
- Keep active manuals easily accessible
- Prioritize frequently-referenced documents

## Tips

1. **Pin Your Active Items:** Pin clusters and manuals you use daily
2. **Unpin When Done:** Unpin seasonal or completed items to keep your list clean
3. **Visual Feedback:** Look for the pin icon - it shows what's pinned at a glance
4. **Automatic Sorting:** Pinned items automatically stay on top even after refresh

## Example Workflow

**Scenario:** You're a DIET Principal managing 50 clusters and 20 manuals

**Without Pin Feature:**
- Scroll through all 50 clusters to find your primary focus area
- Search through 20 manuals to find current training material
- Repeat this every time you access the platform

**With Pin Feature:**
- Pin your 3 main clusters → they're always at the top
- Pin the 2 active training manuals → instant access
- Save time and reduce frustration

## Technical Notes

- **Persistence:** Your pin choices are saved in the database
- **Performance:** Pinned items load instantly with the list
- **No Limit:** Pin as many items as you need (though we recommend keeping it focused)
- **Sorting:** Pinned items are sorted by when they were created/uploaded
